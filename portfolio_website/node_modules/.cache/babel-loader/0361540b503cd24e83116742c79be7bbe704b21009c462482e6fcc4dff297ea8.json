But in that case, it’s still an above average wine and while it’s not to the quality we seek to recommend, as a user, it’s\r\n          not a terribly off algorithm.\r\n       If the wine is a three but gets recommended, I’d be upset. We need to\r\n        be careful to note the bias and work to ensure the bias for false positives is below one on average. </p>\r\n      <h2>Results</h2>\r\n    <p> I had an accuracy score of 78%, close to what I was aiming for and giving the low stakes of buying wine,\r\n       a very acceptable number in my mind.
